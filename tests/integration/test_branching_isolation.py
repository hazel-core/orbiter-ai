"""Integration tests for conversation branching isolation.

US-INT-018: Verifies agent.branch() creates isolated conversation histories
where changes in one branch do not affect the other.

Branch A receives VOLCANO_TOPIC prompts; Branch B receives GLACIER_TOPIC
prompts.  Memory is queried by task_id to confirm each branch stores only
its own messages with no cross-contamination.
