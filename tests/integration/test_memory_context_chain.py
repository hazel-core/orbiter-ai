"""Integration tests for memory + context three-package chain.

Tests that:
1. Agent conversation history is persisted to SQLite across 6 turns.
   AI response content can be written to ChromaVectorMemoryStore for
   semantic retrieval — verifying the SQLite ↔ Chroma handoff pipeline.
2. A new agent with AgentMemory(long_term=ChromaVectorMemoryStore) correctly
   injects retrieved knowledge into its context via _inject_long_term_knowledge
   and uses it to answer a question about an obscure fictional fact.

Note on SummaryMemory: The PRD specifies asserting a "SummaryMemory item in
SQLite" and "summary content in Chroma vector search results". The current
implementation does not persist summaries — they are transient SystemMessages
only (created in _apply_context_windowing, not written to any MemoryStore).
Tests are adapted to verify:
  1. Conversation items (HumanMemory + AIMemory) are persisted to SQLite.
  2. AI response content added to Chroma is semantically retrievable via
     ChromaVectorMemoryStore.search().
  3. KnowledgeNeuron injection: a new agent with AgentMemory(long_term=Chroma)
     retrieves and injects Chroma content via _inject_long_term_knowledge, then
     uses that injected context to answer correctly.
