"""Integration tests for agent self-spawn.

US-INT-012: Verifies that a parent agent can spawn child agents for parallel
subtasks and aggregate their results, and that the depth limit is correctly
enforced without infinite recursion.

The spawn mechanism in Orbiter registers a ``spawn_self(task)`` tool when
``allow_self_spawn=True`` is passed to Agent.  The tool creates a child agent
with ``_spawn_depth = parent._spawn_depth + 1``; when depth reaches
``max_spawn_depth`` the tool returns an error string instead of spawning.
