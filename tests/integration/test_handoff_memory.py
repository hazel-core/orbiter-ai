"""Integration tests for handoff chain with memory persistence.

US-INT-017: Verifies that a three-agent handoff chain (A→B→C) persists
messages from all three agents to a shared SQLiteMemoryStore, identifiable
by agent_id metadata.

The handoff mechanism is output-based: each routing agent outputs exactly
the name of its target agent.  The terminal agent (C) answers the question
by looking at the accumulated conversation history.
