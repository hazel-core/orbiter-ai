"""Integration test for context vector injection via KnowledgeNeuron.

Tests that vector-stored facts are injected into a new agent's context via
_inject_long_term_knowledge (KnowledgeNeuron) and correctly influence the
response when the agent answers a question it could not otherwise know.

The agent is configured with AgentMemory(long_term=ChromaVectorMemoryStore).
When agent.run() is called, _inject_long_term_knowledge() searches Chroma for
items relevant to the user's input and injects them as a <knowledge> block in
the system message, enabling the agent to answer using that injected context.

Note on output_type: output_type on Agent is not auto-applied; the LLM is
instructed via system prompt to return JSON and the result is parsed with
parse_structured_output(result.text, CityResponse).
