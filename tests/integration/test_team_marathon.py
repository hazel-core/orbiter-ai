"""Integration marathon test: multi-agent team with streaming and shared memory.

US-INT-029: Verifies a 3-agent team (coordinator + worker_a + worker_b) streams
events, delegates tasks to the correct specialists via delegation tool calls, and
produces a structured TeamReport with all 4 fields populated.

All 3 agents share a single SQLiteMemoryStore. Streaming with detailed=True
emits TextEvent, ToolCallEvent, and UsageEvent. At least 2 delegation tool
calls (delegate_to_worker_a, delegate_to_worker_b) appear in the event stream.

Memory item pattern in team mode:
  - Each agent persists HumanMemory (input) + AIMemory (output) to shared store
  - Items tagged with agent_id=agent.name for isolation querying
