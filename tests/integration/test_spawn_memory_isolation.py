"""Integration tests for spawn memory isolation.

US-INT-020: Verifies that memory items written by child agent A are not
visible to child agent B when queried by their respective conversation_id.

Each agent stores items tagged with task_id=conversation_id.  Querying the
shared store with child B's session must not return child A's unique fact,
while querying with child A's session must return it.
