"""Config-driven agents — load agents and swarms from YAML.

Demonstrates ``load_agents()`` and ``load_swarm()`` which let you
define agents in a YAML file with variable substitution, then run
them programmatically in Python.

Usage:
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
    uv run python examples/quickstart/config_driven.py
