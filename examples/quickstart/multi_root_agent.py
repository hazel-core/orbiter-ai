"""Multi-root agent — team mode with a lead and workers.

Demonstrates ``Swarm(mode="team")`` where a lead agent delegates
to multiple worker agents via auto-generated ``delegate_to_*``
tools. The lead synthesises the final answer.

Usage:
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
    uv run python examples/quickstart/multi_root_agent.py
