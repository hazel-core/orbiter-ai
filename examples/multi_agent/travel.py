"""Collaborative travel planner — specialised agents plan a trip.

Demonstrates handoff-based collaboration where a lead planner
delegates to specialised agents (flights, hotels, activities) and
synthesises a final itinerary.  Uses ``Swarm(mode="team")`` so
the lead can delegate via auto-generated ``delegate_to_*`` tools.

Usage:
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
    uv run python examples/multi_agent/travel.py
