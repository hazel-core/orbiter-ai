"""Workflow search patterns — fan-out query, aggregate, rank.

Demonstrates a common search pattern where multiple specialist
search agents query different sources in parallel, an aggregator
merges the results, and a ranker produces a final ranked answer.

Usage:
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
    uv run python examples/multi_agent/search_patterns.py
