"""Collaborative debate — two agents argue opposing sides.

Demonstrates a multi-agent debate pattern where two agents present
opposing viewpoints and a moderator synthesises the conclusion.
Uses ``Swarm(mode="workflow")`` with a ``ParallelGroup`` for the
debaters followed by a serial moderator stage.

Usage:
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
    uv run python examples/multi_agent/debate.py
