"""Support for nested swarms — using a Swarm as a node in another Swarm.

A :class:`SwarmNode` wraps a :class:`~orbiter.swarm.Swarm` so it can be
placed in another Swarm's agent list.  The outer Swarm treats it like
any other agent node: it has a ``name``, an ``is_swarm`` marker, and a
``run()`` method that delegates to the inner Swarm.

Context isolation is achieved by never sharing mutable state between
the inner and outer swarms — each execution creates its own
``RunState`` and message history.

Usage::

    inner = Swarm(agents=[a, b], flow="a >> b")
    node = SwarmNode(swarm=inner, name="inner_pipeline")
    outer = Swarm(agents=[c, node, d], flow="c >> inner_pipeline >> d")
    result = await run(outer, "Hello!")

    """Wraps a Swarm so it can be used as a node in another Swarm.

    Provides the same interface that :class:`~orbiter.swarm.Swarm`
    expects from agent nodes — ``name`` attribute and ``run()`` method.
    An ``is_swarm`` marker allows the outer Swarm to detect nested
    swarms via duck-typing.

    Context isolation: the inner Swarm creates its own ``RunState``
    and message history on each ``run()`` invocation.  No mutable
    state leaks between inner and outer executions.

        swarm: The inner Swarm to wrap.
